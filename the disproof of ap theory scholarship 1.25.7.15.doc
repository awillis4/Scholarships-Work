disproof of aptheory by armani willis for 1.25.7.15

ap theory states that the earth is moving too fast to be retaining in it any objects such 

as gases. there are four ways of determining this. 

1. vectors 2. gravitation, 3. centrifuge, 4. accretion, 5. evidence

1. on a normal graph, or in real space, y=f(x). comparing y and x as two vectors means 

that any function f(x) is also that same function y, this, x=f^-1(y), where x-y=y-x. thus, 

although x is commonly referred to y, vetors moving over an xy plane do not interact onto 

themselves. forces acting on these objects over these planes are independent from each 

other.

2. when two object approach each other, whatever mass approaching each other forms the 

relationship F=Gm1m2/r^2. this goes where g is the universal gravitational constant derived

from the formula f=ma. 

F=Sfdt, where Stdt=(t^(n+1)/(n+1)). since a is acceleration, and the slope of v, we can say

that F=mv, where f=mdv. by the integration by parts ((d(mv)/dx)=(mdv/dx)+(vdm/dx)), we get

Smdv=mv-Svdm. thus, dm=dm(Smdv-mv)/Sv, where if Svdm=1, then Sv=1/dm.

since dm=dm, then the term (Smdv-mv)/Sv is always 1, and thus acceleration of objects is 

directly related to the forces imparted on the objects. (see newton's laws)

3. since vectors operate independently from each other, then spin operates as a 

force separate from convergence. therefore, for an object where its spin is due to a 

force, F=Gm1m2/r^2 + kx1x2/r^2, where k is a function of gravitation, and x is the speed 

at which the object is moving. Fr^2 is thus Gm1m2 + kx1x2, and gravitation has a direct 

influence on spin. 

4. given that an object only changes direction when affected by a force, and that motion

across vectors is independent to any other vector, we cannot say that the earth is not 

heavy enough, or is moving too fast to retain the gases and objects within its orbit, since

there was no force imparted on any of these objects to cause them to escape the earth's 

gravitational field. the gases and objects that were always here since the earth started

spinning would have the same energy that they have now, therefore, they are part of the 

earth's gravitation.

5. the most well known works on this subject are the observations of galileo galilei, who 

performed several proofs such as the falling boulders of pisa, and rolling a cannonball

down planes of various inclinations. his works prove physically that vectors interact

independent of each other, where the same cannonball will roll down different inclines of 

the same length at the same rate. also, at the leaning tower of pisa, it was demonstrated 

that objects of 2 weights will still fall at the same rate, and thus that rate is 

independent of the force imparted onto it.

6. i would also like to note that although the proofs provided for ap theory on your 

website have been proven here to be invalid, there is also no circumstantial evidence and 

no references for the details of the formation of the solar system besides illustrations 

that were not drawn to scale. i wish i could save image as since they are spectacular, 

but i cannot do that and this makes me sad.

7. i like doing these things and i believe that practicing these concepts brings us all 

closer to truth. i would like to thank you for posting this scholarship, it is a great 

exercise of exploring and applying basic facts about reality.

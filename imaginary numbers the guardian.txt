Imaginary numbers are useful for identifying the vertical component of an otherwise horizontal function, 

that vertical component could itself mean other things such as the difference between volume and rate, 

and in finance, the intersections between two different accounts. They are an integral part of quantum computing, 

where computers can infer something out of a sum with very little calculation. They can also be used 

for noticing the discrepancies between the price of something and its market value, which can be 

visualized as a chaos complex, a sort of imaginary dynamical system.

for example f(x)=g(x(i+1)), 3x=nx+nxi=nx(1+i), 3/n=(i+1), 3-n/n = i, 3-n=ni, 3/i=2n, n=3/2i.

YOUR QUERY:  Hello, i was interested in finding the hox gene maps of certain plants, specifically trees, in order to compare their anatomical instructions with animals.

This was to find out why animals do certain things in different ways from plants, and how plants came to differ from animals in the first place.

I was also concerned as to why there seems to be no interest in why certain biological phenomenon occur in the way they do, the physical and chemical reasons for the different biological traits.

I have not seen these things on the internet and i was just wondering why.
